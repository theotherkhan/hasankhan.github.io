<p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a powerful,
well-established model compression technique
that can face performance limitations when the
capacity difference between student and teacher
models is severely mismatched (Cho and Hariharan, 2019), or when multiple teachers cause
competing distillation objectives (Du et al.,
2020). To address these issues and improve performance in KD for large language modeling, I explore the implementation of two ideas: using curriculum learning during KD, where training data is sorted based on difficulty, and using Selective Reliance during KD, where a student language model selectively leverages teacher distillation loss for data samples deemed difficult by the curriculum. See the full report <a href="/files/KD_CL_SR_for_LMs.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) is a
model compression technique commonly deployed
in settings where large models are difficult to
store and run. Vanilla KD comprises of a dual
model student-teacher modeling framework, where
a small capacity student model aims to mimic the
performance of a larger capacity teacher model by
learning the distribution of the output labels generated from the teacher model trained on the same
dataset. Specifically, the student model uses a bipartite loss function L_student that incorporates both
L_kd (the KD loss measured by the KL divergence
between the softmax of the student output logits
PS and the softmax of the teacher output logits P_T ,
scaled by the temperature parameter τ ) and L_ce
(the standard cross entropy training loss using the
true labels ytrue). The parameter λ controls the
weight given to each component loss. The student
loss and its component losses are defined below:</p>
<p>$$ L_{ce} = CE(y_{true},P_S) $$
$$ L_{kd} = \tau^2 KL(P_T,P_S) $$
$$ L_{student} = (1 - \lambda)L_{ce} + \lambda L_{kd} $$</p>
<p>The general framework is visualized below:</p>
<p><img src="/files/kd3.jpg" alt="image info"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, KD has been shown to provide minimal
to no performance gains for certain tasks, such
as image recognition on ImageNet (Zagoruyko
and Komodakis, 2016). Cho and Hariharan note
that empirical results establishing the generality
of KD efficacy for various tasks are nonexistent. They examine the
reasons behind these failures, noting that large
differences in student teacher model capacities
may limit the student model’s ability to minimize
both training loss and KD loss, forcing the student
to minimize the KD loss over the train loss. In
addition to capacity gaps between student and
teachers, KD frameworks that involve distillation
from an ensemble of teachers require n-paritite
loss functions, in which conflict can exists between
different teacher models, which can adversely
effect distillation loss (Du et al., 2020).</p>
<p>From these findings, I propose selective reliance,
a KD technique for dynamically changing the
student’s reliance on KD loss, in order to improve
model accuracy. Selective reliance is implemented
by updating λ in LStudent at the sample level,
where λ is determined by the difficulty of the
sample. Difficulty is defined in the context of
Curriculum Learning (CL), a training strategy for
improving model convergence speed and accuracy
that involves training on easily learnable samples
before more difficult ones (Bengio et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Difficulty rankings for samples can be determined
using the confidence scores generated by either the
teacher model (teacher-generated curriculum) or
the student model (student-generated curriculum).
In the former, the teacher model would also act
as the difficulty scoring function (Hacohen and
Weinshall, 2019) for each datapoint in the the student’s curriculum, calculated before the student
training process. In the latter, the student model
would generate its own curriculum during student
training by looking at confidence scores generated
during previous epochs in training, as described by
snapshot learning (Zhao et al., 2021). For this experiment, I use the confidence scores generated by
the student model (student-generated curriculum)
during training. I hypothesize that relying on the
teacher model is only in the student’s best interest
when the sample being evaluated is &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; as
determined by the curriculum, and that accuracy
yielded from vanilla knowledge distillation (KD)
and knowledge distillation with curriculum
learning (KD-CL) can be improved upon with
selective reliance (KD-CL-SR) techniques built
into the distillation framework.</p>
